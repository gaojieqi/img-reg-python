This project is used to recognize the numbers placed in block.

Need someone to optimize the algorithm of seperating the numbers in chaos.

Digits-Detection is the next step but good proposition around it is fully welcome.Please give the pseudocode in 
order to show your thought process.In me,flowing methods are under consideration:

1.svm

2.zernike.mounent

3.template matching

4.KNearest-k, which I have already tested and gives bad result

=============================
Notice:

The file works in python 2.7

Such modules are needed:

1.numpy

2.scipy

3.opencv

4.sklearn

5.matplotlib

6.skimage

Works are gathered in test.py,your can change cv2.imread() parameter in test.py to deal with different images,check it out.

Here are some references about opencv:

-------------------UPDATED ON 10.24-----------------------
Progamme which used to recognize the digits has almost finished now, with about 80% accuracy.

Find a way to improve the accuracy
